Dependencies: MiniNet

Creates three-node network:
H1 -- S1 -- H2 -- S2 -- H3

All links are bidirectional.

Setting up Mininet :

These directions seem to work universally :

0. cd ~
1. git clone git://github.com/mininet/mininet
2. cd mininet
3. util/install.sh -fnv

DO NOT clone elsewhere, DO NOT try and do util/install.sh -a (like the Download site suggests).
